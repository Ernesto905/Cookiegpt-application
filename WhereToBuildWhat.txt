The logic for building your application should be defined in your Dockerfile, 
while the logic for building the Docker image and uploading it to a Docker registry 
should be defined in your Jenkins pipeline.

Here's a bit more detail:

    Dockerfile: The Dockerfile is a text document that contains all the commands a 
    user could call on the command line to assemble an image. In your case, it would 
    include the commands to set up the environment for your application 
    (like installing necessary packages), copy your source code into the image, 
    and set the command to run your application.

    Jenkins Pipeline: The Jenkins pipeline automates the process of 
    building the Docker image from the Dockerfile, testing the image, and then 
    \pushing the image to a Docker registry if the tests pass. The pipeline is triggered 
    whenever you make a change to your source code.

So, in summary, the Dockerfile contains the instructions to build your application, 
and the Jenkins pipeline contains the instructions to build the Docker image from the 
Dockerfile, test the image, and push the image to a Docker registry.
